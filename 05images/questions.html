        <h2>We're here to help!</h2>

        <h2>General Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>What is mosaic art?</strong><br>Mosaic art is a technique that uses small pieces of tile, glass,
                stone, or other materials to create a design or image.</li>
            <li><strong>How long has mosaic art been around?</strong><br>Mosaic art dates back thousands of years, with
                early examples found in Mesopotamian, Greek, and Roman cultures.</li>
            <li><strong>What materials are used in mosaics?</strong><br>Common materials include glass, ceramic,
                porcelain, stone, pebbles, and even recycled materials like broken pottery.</li>
            <li><strong>Is mosaic art difficult to learn?</strong><br>Mosaic art is accessible to beginners but requires
                patience and practice.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>What tools do I need to start making mosaics?</strong><br>Basic tools include tile nippers,
                tweezers, adhesive, grout, a spatula, and safety gear like gloves and goggles.</li>
            <li><strong>How do I choose the right adhesive for my mosaic?</strong><br>The adhesive depends on your
                surface and materials. For indoor projects, white PVA glue or thin-set mortar works well, while outdoor
                mosaics require weatherproof adhesive.</li>
            <li><strong>What is the best surface for a mosaic?</strong><br>Common surfaces include wood, cement, mesh,
                and glass.</li>
            <li><strong>Do I need to seal my mosaic?</strong><br>Sealing is necessary for porous materials like unglazed
                tiles or outdoor projects exposed to weather.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Techniques & Design</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>How do I cut tiles for mosaics?</strong><br>Tile nippers or wheeled glass cutters are commonly
                used for shaping mosaic pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>What is the difference between direct and indirect mosaic methods?</strong><br>The direct method
                involves placing tiles directly onto the surface, while the indirect method involves placing tiles on a
                temporary surface before transferring them.</li>
            <li><strong>How do I create a mosaic design?</strong><br>Start with a sketch or template, and plan colors
                and patterns before placing your tiles.</li>
            <li><strong>How do I grout a mosaic?</strong><br>Apply grout over the entire surface, pressing it into the
                gaps. Wipe away excess grout with a damp sponge and allow it to dry before sealing.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Troubleshooting & Maintenance</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>My tiles keep shifting while I work. What should I do?</strong><br>Use a slow-drying adhesive,
                work in small sections, and allow drying time before moving to the next area.</li>
            <li><strong>How do I clean a mosaic?</strong><br>For indoor mosaics, use a soft cloth and mild soap. For
                outdoor mosaics, a soft brush and water work well.</li>
            <li><strong>Can a mosaic be repaired if it gets damaged?</strong><br>Yes! Carefully remove the broken
                pieces, apply new adhesive, replace the tiles, and re-grout the area.</li>
        </ol>
